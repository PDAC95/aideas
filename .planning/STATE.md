# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-04 after v1.2 milestone start)

**Core value:** Customers can monitor automations, request new ones, and see their ROI from a single bilingual dashboard — paired with an operations team who can fulfill what they request.
**Current focus:** v1.2 Admin Dashboard — Phase 17 Admin Foundation in flight (Plan 01 complete)

## Current Position

Phase: Phase 17 — Admin Foundation — In progress (1/3 plans complete)
Plan: 17-01 complete; next is 17-02 (Admin route gate / middleware / assertPlatformStaff helper)
Status: Database foundation shipped (platform_staff table, helpers, RLS bypass, super_admin seed). Ready to execute 17-02.
Last activity: 2026-05-05 — Plan 17-01 executed (migration 20260506000001_admin_foundation.sql, 436 LOC, 38 admin RLS policies + 2 helper functions + super_admin seed)

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | v1.0 | v1.1 | v1.2 (target) |
|--------|------|------|---------------|
| Phases | 6 | 9 | 7 |
| Plans | 16 | 28 | ~20 |
| Requirements | 54/54 | 38/38 | 31 (planned) |
| Timeline | 70 days | 21 days | TBD |

### Per-plan execution metrics (v1.2)

| Phase-Plan | Duration (min) | Tasks | Files changed |
|------------|----------------|-------|---------------|
| 17-01      | 10             | 2     | 1             |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions (Phase 17 execution, 2026-05-05)

- **Helper functions are SECURITY DEFINER + STABLE + `SET search_path = ''`** — callers without RLS access to `platform_staff` can still check membership; STABLE lets the planner hoist the call out of per-row evaluation; empty search_path prevents schema-hijack attacks.
- **Admin RLS is additive, not replacing** — 38 new admin policies coexist with existing org-scoped client policies; Postgres OR-combines policies for the same command. Clients keep their access exactly as before.
- **Mutable tables use 4 separate policies (SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)** rather than `FOR ALL` — clearer audit trail, easier to revoke a single verb later.
- **Immutable tables get SELECT only for admins too** — `automation_executions` and `chat_messages` retain their no-INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE-for-authenticated-users posture even for staff. Soft-delete is a deferred option if a real need arises.
- **`chat_messages_insert_clients` preserved untouched** — admin chat sends in the future would use service_role (consistent with existing architecture); this surfaces as a flag for Phase 19.
- **First super_admin seeded inside the migration itself** — idempotent + safe-no-op via `DO $$` block with `RAISE NOTICE` fallback; the moment `pdmckinster@gmail.com` signs up, re-running the migration promotes them.

### Decisions (v1.2 questioning gate, 2026-05-04)

- **Operations-first sequencing** — admin before Stripe. Without admin, the team cannot fulfill orders that Stripe would create. v1.1 shipped customer side; v1.2 ships team side; v1.3 wires Stripe.
- **Admin lives at `/admin/*`** — same Next.js app, role-gated route. No subdomain, no separate repo.
- **`platform_staff` table** — new table with FK to `auth.users`, separate from `organization_members` (which scopes per-org client roles). Bypasses org-scope via RLS `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM platform_staff WHERE user_id = auth.uid())`.
- **Two staff roles from day one** — `super_admin | operator` in schema; UI for staff invitation deferred until needed.
- **Visual: same layout, different banner** — reuse customer sidebar/header/components, add "AIDEAS Admin" banner or title. NO redesign of shadcn theme.
- **Bilingual EN/ES** — strict parity, follows project rule.
- **Seed-vs-prod cleanup deferred** — decide at v1.3 deploy time, not now.
- **Carry-over from v1.1 lands first** — Next.js 16 build blocker, AutomationSuccessRate placeholder, assertOrgMembership consolidation, symmetric reCAPTCHA bypass — bundled as Phase 16 to unblock CI before admin work begins.
- **Single-step approval** — approving a request flips it to `approved` AND creates the automation row in `in_setup` in one transaction.
- **Reject requires reason** — non-empty rejection reason enforced via form validation, persisted in request notes.
- **Automation admin detail is read-only** — no field editing in admin; only status transitions via dedicated buttons (in_setup→active, active↔paused, active|paused→archived).

### Roadmap (defined 2026-05-04)

| Phase | Name | Plans | Reqs |
|-------|------|-------|------|
| 16 | Carry-over Cleanup | 3 | CARRY-01..04 |
| 17 | Admin Foundation | 3 | FOUND-01..05, I18N-01 |
| 18 | Catalog Admin | 3 | CTLG-01..05, I18N-01 |
| 19 | Requests Inbox | 3 | REQS-01..04, I18N-01 |
| 20 | Automations Admin | 3 | AUTM-01..05, I18N-01 |
| 21 | Clients Admin | 3 | CLNT-01..05, I18N-01 |
| 22 | Admin Home | 2 | HOME-01..03, I18N-01 |

Coverage: 31/31 v1.2 requirements mapped. I18N-01 cross-cuts every UI-bearing phase.

### Blockers/Concerns

- v1.1 build blocker: `next/dynamic ssr:false` in `web/src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/automations/[id]/page.tsx:16` breaks `npm run build` under Next.js 16 + Turbopack. Targeted by Phase 16 (CARRY-01) so CI is green before Phase 17 begins.

### Pending Todos

(none — fresh roadmap, ready to plan Phase 16)

## Session Continuity

**Last session:** 2026-05-05 — Executed Plan 17-01 (Admin Foundation database layer). Stopped at: Completed 17-01-PLAN.md.
**Next action:** `/gsd:execute-phase 17` (or `/gsd:execute-plan 17 02`) — execute Plan 17-02 (Admin route gate / middleware / `assertPlatformStaff` helper). Plan 17-02 consumes `is_platform_staff()` directly via Supabase RPC or a `platform_staff` self-select.
