# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-04 after v1.2 milestone start)

**Core value:** Customers can monitor automations, request new ones, and see their ROI from a single bilingual dashboard — paired with an operations team who can fulfill what they request.
**Current focus:** v1.2 Admin Dashboard — roadmap defined, ready to plan Phase 16

## Current Position

Phase: Phase 16 — Carry-over Cleanup — Not started
Plan: —
Status: Ready to plan (run `/gsd:plan-phase 16`)
Last activity: 2026-05-04 — Roadmap created (Phases 16-22), 31/31 v1.2 requirements mapped

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | v1.0 | v1.1 | v1.2 (target) |
|--------|------|------|---------------|
| Phases | 6 | 9 | 7 |
| Plans | 16 | 28 | ~20 |
| Requirements | 54/54 | 38/38 | 31 (planned) |
| Timeline | 70 days | 21 days | TBD |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions (v1.2 questioning gate, 2026-05-04)

- **Operations-first sequencing** — admin before Stripe. Without admin, the team cannot fulfill orders that Stripe would create. v1.1 shipped customer side; v1.2 ships team side; v1.3 wires Stripe.
- **Admin lives at `/admin/*`** — same Next.js app, role-gated route. No subdomain, no separate repo.
- **`platform_staff` table** — new table with FK to `auth.users`, separate from `organization_members` (which scopes per-org client roles). Bypasses org-scope via RLS `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM platform_staff WHERE user_id = auth.uid())`.
- **Two staff roles from day one** — `super_admin | operator` in schema; UI for staff invitation deferred until needed.
- **Visual: same layout, different banner** — reuse customer sidebar/header/components, add "AIDEAS Admin" banner or title. NO redesign of shadcn theme.
- **Bilingual EN/ES** — strict parity, follows project rule.
- **Seed-vs-prod cleanup deferred** — decide at v1.3 deploy time, not now.
- **Carry-over from v1.1 lands first** — Next.js 16 build blocker, AutomationSuccessRate placeholder, assertOrgMembership consolidation, symmetric reCAPTCHA bypass — bundled as Phase 16 to unblock CI before admin work begins.
- **Single-step approval** — approving a request flips it to `approved` AND creates the automation row in `in_setup` in one transaction.
- **Reject requires reason** — non-empty rejection reason enforced via form validation, persisted in request notes.
- **Automation admin detail is read-only** — no field editing in admin; only status transitions via dedicated buttons (in_setup→active, active↔paused, active|paused→archived).

### Roadmap (defined 2026-05-04)

| Phase | Name | Plans | Reqs |
|-------|------|-------|------|
| 16 | Carry-over Cleanup | 3 | CARRY-01..04 |
| 17 | Admin Foundation | 3 | FOUND-01..05, I18N-01 |
| 18 | Catalog Admin | 3 | CTLG-01..05, I18N-01 |
| 19 | Requests Inbox | 3 | REQS-01..04, I18N-01 |
| 20 | Automations Admin | 3 | AUTM-01..05, I18N-01 |
| 21 | Clients Admin | 3 | CLNT-01..05, I18N-01 |
| 22 | Admin Home | 2 | HOME-01..03, I18N-01 |

Coverage: 31/31 v1.2 requirements mapped. I18N-01 cross-cuts every UI-bearing phase.

### Blockers/Concerns

- v1.1 build blocker: `next/dynamic ssr:false` in `web/src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/automations/[id]/page.tsx:16` breaks `npm run build` under Next.js 16 + Turbopack. Targeted by Phase 16 (CARRY-01) so CI is green before Phase 17 begins.

### Pending Todos

(none — fresh roadmap, ready to plan Phase 16)

## Session Continuity

**Next action:** `/gsd:plan-phase 16` — decompose Carry-over Cleanup into atomic plans with verification loop.
