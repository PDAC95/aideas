# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-04 after v1.2 milestone start)

**Core value:** Customers can monitor automations, request new ones, and see their ROI from a single bilingual dashboard — paired with an operations team who can fulfill what they request.
**Current focus:** v1.2 Admin Dashboard — Phase 17 Admin Foundation complete (3/3 plans); next is Phase 18 Catalog Admin

## Current Position

Phase: Phase 17 — Admin Foundation — Complete (3/3 plans)
Plan: 17-03 complete; next is Phase 18 (Catalog Admin) — sketched as 3 plans: 18-01 list + filters, 18-02 create/edit form + validation, 18-03 active/featured toggles
Status: Admin shell shipped — fresh AdminLayout + AdminSidebar + AdminHeader (no customer-component reuse), orange ADMIN badge, 5 placeholder pages, 27-key admin.* i18n namespace at full EN/ES parity, /admin/login retrofitted to use the namespace. Build green; 6 admin routes registered (/admin + 4 sub-pages + /admin/login).
Last activity: 2026-05-05 — Plan 17-03 executed (2 tasks, 13 files, 517 LOC; admin shell UI + i18n + login retrofit)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions (Phase 17-03 execution, 2026-05-05)

- **Admin badge color is orange (`bg-orange-500`)** — high-contrast against the dark gray-900 sidebar and the white-text login page; consistent across mobile top bar, sidebar header, login page, and AdminHeader subtitle area, so the visual cue never disappears regardless of viewport.
- **Sidebar palette intentionally distinct from customer DashboardNav** — gray-900 background, gray-300 inactive text, orange-500/15 + orange-300 active states. Customer side uses white card + purple accents. A staff member who toggles to /admin sees an obviously different UI in <500ms.
- **AdminHeader hidden on mobile (`lg:flex`)** — the mobile sidebar bar already shows the logo + ADMIN badge inline; a duplicate header would waste vertical space.
- **Active sidebar state matches both exact path AND prefix** — Home uses `exact: true` so it does not stay highlighted under sub-routes; sub-pages match prefix so e.g. `/admin/catalog/[id]` keeps the Catalog item active.
- **Spanish strings drop accents** (Catalogo, Cerrar sesion, Contrasena, Solicitudes...) — matches existing es.json convention; keeps Mexican-neutral phrasing.
- **Server actions return English error strings; client localizes via `localizeError()` switch** — cheaper than refactoring `signInStaff` to return discriminated codes; revisit if more callers need the same strings.
- **Inline retrofit of `/admin/login` + `AdminLoginForm` to consume `admin.*` keys in 17-03** — avoided a half-translated state where some Phase 17 pages used i18n keys and the entry point did not. I18N-01 is now actually satisfied for the entire phase.
- **Convention established for Phase 18-22 pages:** `(admin)/admin/<section>/page.tsx` for shell-wrapped pages; `(admin-auth)/admin/login` already lives outside the shell. Future bare/fullscreen admin pages should use a new `(admin-bare)` route group rather than fight the layout.

### Decisions (Phase 17-02 execution, 2026-05-05)

- **Two-cookie session scheme** — customer (`sb-*`) and admin (`sb-admin-*`) sessions coexist in the same browser via Supabase `cookieOptions.name`. Pattern matches Stripe / Supabase / Vercel where you can be logged into multiple workspaces simultaneously.
- **Two `getUser()` calls per request** (customer + admin in parallel) — extra ~30ms of network IO traded for correctness. A single Supabase client cannot read two cookie scopes in one pass; `Promise.all` keeps it parallel.
- **`/admin/*` branch wins over customer logic** — path is checked first; customer auth gates do not run for admin paths. Keeps the two flows from interfering when a customer accidentally hits `/admin` or vice versa.
- **Non-staff who land in admin scope are SIGNED OUT before bouncing** — defense in depth: prevents a stale admin cookie sitting in a removed staff member's browser.
- **`signInStaff` server action double-checks platform_staff after Supabase auth** — second query and explicit signOut on failure, so an RLS regression on `platform_staff_select_self` cannot leak admin sessions to non-staff.
- **No Google OAuth on /admin/login** — staff are seeded by SQL/migration only in v1.2 (per CONTEXT.md). Email/password keeps the surface area minimal.
- **/admin/login uses hardcoded English (no next-intl yet)** — admin i18n keys are 17-03's job. Cross-plan dependency on a non-existent namespace is avoided.
- **`(admin-auth)` route group for /admin/login** — kept outside the future `(admin)` shell from 17-03 so it has no sidebar, no header, no auth-gate-component.
- **Staff-on-/dashboard cross-redirect** — when `customerUser` (sb-* scope) is in `platform_staff`, middleware redirects them to `/admin`. Catches the case where a staff member signs into the customer login by accident.

### Decisions (Phase 17 execution, 2026-05-05)

- **Helper functions are SECURITY DEFINER + STABLE + `SET search_path = ''`** — callers without RLS access to `platform_staff` can still check membership; STABLE lets the planner hoist the call out of per-row evaluation; empty search_path prevents schema-hijack attacks.
- **Admin RLS is additive, not replacing** — 38 new admin policies coexist with existing org-scoped client policies; Postgres OR-combines policies for the same command. Clients keep their access exactly as before.
- **Mutable tables use 4 separate policies (SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)** rather than `FOR ALL` — clearer audit trail, easier to revoke a single verb later.
- **Immutable tables get SELECT only for admins too** — `automation_executions` and `chat_messages` retain their no-INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE-for-authenticated-users posture even for staff. Soft-delete is a deferred option if a real need arises.
- **`chat_messages_insert_clients` preserved untouched** — admin chat sends in the future would use service_role (consistent with existing architecture); this surfaces as a flag for Phase 19.
- **First super_admin seeded inside the migration itself** — idempotent + safe-no-op via `DO $$` block with `RAISE NOTICE` fallback; the moment `pdmckinster@gmail.com` signs up, re-running the migration promotes them.

### Decisions (v1.2 questioning gate, 2026-05-04)

- **Operations-first sequencing** — admin before Stripe. Without admin, the team cannot fulfill orders that Stripe would create. v1.1 shipped customer side; v1.2 ships team side; v1.3 wires Stripe.
- **Admin lives at `/admin/*`** — same Next.js app, role-gated route. No subdomain, no separate repo.
- **`platform_staff` table** — new table with FK to `auth.users`, separate from `organization_members` (which scopes per-org client roles). Bypasses org-scope via RLS `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM platform_staff WHERE user_id = auth.uid())`.
- **Two staff roles from day one** — `super_admin | operator` in schema; UI for staff invitation deferred until needed.
- **Visual: same layout, different banner** — reuse customer sidebar/header/components, add "AIDEAS Admin" banner or title. NO redesign of shadcn theme.
- **Bilingual EN/ES** — strict parity, follows project rule.
- **Seed-vs-prod cleanup deferred** — decide at v1.3 deploy time, not now.
- **Carry-over from v1.1 lands first** — Next.js 16 build blocker, AutomationSuccessRate placeholder, assertOrgMembership consolidation, symmetric reCAPTCHA bypass — bundled as Phase 16 to unblock CI before admin work begins.
- **Single-step approval** — approving a request flips it to `approved` AND creates the automation row in `in_setup` in one transaction.
- **Reject requires reason** — non-empty rejection reason enforced via form validation, persisted in request notes.
- **Automation admin detail is read-only** — no field editing in admin; only status transitions via dedicated buttons (in_setup→active, active↔paused, active|paused→archived).

### Roadmap (defined 2026-05-04)

| Phase | Name | Plans | Reqs |
|-------|------|-------|------|
| 16 | Carry-over Cleanup | 3 | CARRY-01..04 |
| 17 | Admin Foundation | 3 | FOUND-01..05, I18N-01 |
| 18 | Catalog Admin | 3 | CTLG-01..05, I18N-01 |
| 19 | Requests Inbox | 3 | REQS-01..04, I18N-01 |
| 20 | Automations Admin | 3 | AUTM-01..05, I18N-01 |
| 21 | Clients Admin | 3 | CLNT-01..05, I18N-01 |
| 22 | Admin Home | 2 | HOME-01..03, I18N-01 |

Coverage: 31/31 v1.2 requirements mapped. I18N-01 cross-cuts every UI-bearing phase.

### Blockers/Concerns

- v1.1 build blocker: `next/dynamic ssr:false` in `web/src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/automations/[id]/page.tsx:16` breaks `npm run build` under Next.js 16 + Turbopack. Targeted by Phase 16 (CARRY-01) so CI is green before Phase 17 begins.

### Pending Todos

(none — fresh roadmap, ready to plan Phase 16)

## Session Continuity

**Last session:** 2026-05-05 — Executed Plan 17-03 (Admin shell UI). Stopped at: Completed 17-03-PLAN.md.
**Next action:** Phase 17 is complete (3/3 plans). Run `/gsd:verify-work 17` to UAT the admin shell end-to-end (login, navigate sidebar, switch language, logout, verify customer session unaffected). After verification passes, plan Phase 18 (Catalog Admin) — first capability phase that consumes the admin shell.
